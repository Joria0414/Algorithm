# algorithm

Algorithm is one of the basic course of computer science and this is a repository for assignment in algorithm. I share couple of instances of some foundamental algorithm like graph algorithms, search and sorting, dynamic programming and so on.




1.recursive/divide and conquer algorithm
lab 1-5 (first 2 is nothing but r/d)

2.dynamic programming
lab 6-9

3.greedy algorithm
lab 10-11

4.backtracking
lab 12-13

5.branch and bound method
lab 14
